### Hi there 👋

I am a college student, and I am fighting against my life for changing my major.

I am passionate about game design and suffer from my art foundation and major. If you are willing to cooperate with me, I welcome it very much!

I want to transfer to a major of "Digital Media Art". This major that only art students can study will make me, an engineering student, spend an extra 2 years.
(must be transferred to the same college of "Industrial Design" before the second year To "Digital Media Art").

But for the sake of dreams, delaying graduation for two years is nothing.

我是一个普通带学生，正在与生活对抗。

热衷于游戏设计，苦于自己的美术基础和就读专业。如果你愿意和我合作，我表示非常欢迎！

计划转入专业是“数字媒体艺术”，这个艺术生才能去的专业会让我这个工科生多付出2年的时间（先转入同院的工业设计专业，第二年才能转到数媒）。

但是为了梦想，延毕两年又算什么呢？
