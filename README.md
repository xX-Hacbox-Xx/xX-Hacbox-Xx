### Hi there 👋

I am a college student, and I am fighting against my life for changing my major.

I am passionate about game design and suffer from my art foundation and major. If you are willing to cooperate with me, I welcome it very much!

Thank you for reading, friendly stranger!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning AHUT
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on who are interested in game design and have a certain art foundation.
- 📫 How to reach me: email：hiackerbox@outlook.com

我是一个普通带学生，正在为转专业与生活对抗。

热衷于游戏设计，苦于自己的美术基础和就读专业。如果你愿意和我合作，我表示非常欢迎！

谢谢你的阅读，友善的陌生人！
